<h1 id="note-taking-with-typst-and-neovim-in-2026">Note-taking with Typst and Neovim in 2026</h1>
<div class="creation-date">
2026-01-01
</div>
<p>More than two years ago, I wrote an article about the process of <a href="/typst-notes">taking notes
with Typst in Neovim</a>; soon after, it became the most popular
post on this blog.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Since then, however, the contents of that article have
become outdated, so I&#8217;m writing this as an updated version of that post.
The goal of this article is to again document how I write lecture notes in Typst,
but now with the tooling of 2026.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve spent two years using Typst for taking notes, I can say that I&#8217;m
quite happy with it. I&#8217;m at the level where I can effortlessly type notes as
fast (sometimes faster) than instructors can write on the board, including
mathematical notation. I also use Typst when typing up homework.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>First, let&#8217;s recall the goals for my note-taking.</p>
<p>During lectures, I take notes in real time on my laptop,
and I do not spend time after class to clean up my notes.
This is a real example of how my notes look like (click for more detail):</p>
<p><a href="/public/img/typst-notes2/pages.png"><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/pages.png" alt="Image of two pages from my typed notes." /></a></p>
<p>Because of the way I write notes, it has to be fast and efficient,
otherwise I can&#8217;t keep up with the lecture.
More precisely, the following are my criteria for a good note-taking setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking notes should be convenient.
That is, I can open my notes and start writing almost immediately.
The system should be fast and responsive.</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax for writing notes should be easy to remember and to write.
If the syntax for common things like fractions are painful to type, I&#8217;d rather use plain text or handwritten notes.</p></li>
<li><p>I need my notes to support math, figures, and related features for my courses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Originally, I was quite inspired by <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/">Gilles Castel&#8217;s
system</a> which uses LaTeX for
note-taking. Unfortunately, LaTeX fails some of the criteria above; it compiles
slowly, which is inconvenient, and it has cryptic, weird syntax from decades
ago.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> So when I tried to write LaTeX, I ended up just giving up and writing
plain text documents, because they are simply more convenient to write.</p>
<p>Then, I found <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst">Typst</a>,
which is sort of a mix between LaTeX and Markdown.
On one hand, just like LaTeX, it&#8217;s designed for writing about math and other technical subjects,
so it supports equations and figures.
On the other hand, like Markdown, Typst has simple syntax.
For instance, compare the notation for lists:</p>
<p>LaTeX:</p>
<pre><code>\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is the first list item.
    \item Another entry.
    \item A last entry.
\end{enumerate}
</code></pre>
<p>Typst:</p>
<pre><code>+ This is the first list item.
+ Another entry.
+ A last entry.
</code></pre>
<p>The Typst notation requires much less typing than the LaTeX notation. This is
just one example; I would say that in general writing things in Typst is less
wordy than writing it in LaTeX.</p>
<p>So, according to my criteria for a good note-taking system, Typst is the best,
which is why I use it.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-typst-in-neovim">Compiling Typst in Neovim</h2>
<div class="notecard note markdown-alert markdown-alert-note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>This post focuses on local compilation, integrated with an editor (Neovim). For
those who don&#8217;t live in the terminal, Typst has a closed-source <a href="https://typst.app">web
app</a>, which is equivalent to Overleaf for LaTeX.
The web app does have basic Vim binds, if that is what you need.</p>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started writing Typst.</p>
<p>Once you have Typst installed,
you can already start writing in a <code>.typ</code> document with your favourite text editor.
Run <code>typst watch document.typ</code>, and Typst will compile to <code>document.pdf</code>.
There is no boilerplate required; just start writing text.</p>
<p>In this section, I&#8217;ll show you how to better integrate this process with your
editor.</p>
<h3 id="tinymist">Tinymist</h3>
<p>Since 2023, many things have changed in the Typst ecosystem. We now have proper
Language Server Protocol (LSP) server support for Typst, which helps editors
understand and manipulate Typst code. You can install the
<a href="https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist">Tinymist</a> language server, which
has many features, like autocomplete, error detection, code formatting, and
notably instant preview in a browser window. Every time you edit the document,
Tinymist automatically compiles it and shows you a preview. You can even click
in the preview, and have it sync position with the editor window:</p>
<p><video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/public/img/typst-notes2/preview.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video></p>
<p>To keep this post brief though, I&#8217;ll avoid specifying too many details about
how to set up language servers in Neovim; there is plenty of information out
there already, and the configuration depends on how your specific setup works.</p>
<p>One thing I will add here is that once you have Tinymist running, you can
start the preview with the following Lua command (which you should bind to a key):</p>
<pre><code>vim.lsp.get_clients({ name = "tinymist" })[1]:exec_cmd({ command = "tinymist.startDefaultPreview", title = "Preview" })
</code></pre>
<div class="notecard note markdown-alert markdown-alert-note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
If you hate having to configure everything but still like Vim-style editing,
try the <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> editor, which automatically
configures language servers (and many other features) for you. Once you have
Tinymist running, use this command to start the preview:</p>
<pre><code>:lsp-workspace-command tinymist.startDefaultPreview
</code></pre>
<p>I am looking to switch to Helix, but as of now the snippet support isn&#8217;t good enough.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="typst-watch">Typst watch</h3>
<p>The one issue I have with Tinymist is that using it drains battery on my laptop.
which is a big disadvantage when typing notes in class.
Because it consumes more power, I actually don&#8217;t use Tinymist that often.</p>
<p>Instead, I still use the same setup as I did in 2023: I have VimScript binds that open
<code>typst watch</code> in a tiny side pane, and open a PDF reader (Zathura) to view the
output besides the editor.</p>
<pre><code>function GitRoot()
    return fnamemodify(finddir(&#39;.git&#39;, ";"), ":h")
endfunc

" compile typst doc on write
function TypstWatch()
       vsp
       vertical resize 20
       exec &#39;terminal &#39; .. &#39;typst watch --root &#39; .. GitRoot() .. " " .. expand("%:")
       exec "norm \&#60;c-w&#62;h"
endfunc

nnoremap &#60;silent&#62; &#60;leader&#62;fc :call TypstWatch()&#60;cr&#62;

nnoremap &#60;silent&#62;&#60;leader&#62;fr :silent exec "!zathura --fork " . expand("%:p:r") . ".pdf &#38;"&#60;cr&#62;
</code></pre>
<p>Every time I save the Typst source file, it compiles
and shows the result in the Zathura window:</p>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/zathura.png" alt="Screenshot with the Neovim window on the left showing an error from typst output, and Zathura on the right." /></p>
<p>As you can see, errors are also displayed in the side pane. Based on personal
experience, this setup consumes noticeably less battery than running Tinymist.
I assume Tinymist consumes more resources because it is constantly compiling
your code after each keystroke, rather than when you save.</p>
<div class="notecard note markdown-alert markdown-alert-note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
A difference from the original code is that we now have to set a compilation root for Typst.
If your file accesses external data (e.g. images on disk), the data needs to be within the compilation root.
(This feature prevents Typst files from reading your SSH private keys.)
For my setup, I set the root of my notes Git repository as the compilation root.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="math-code">Math &#38; code</h2>
<p>I often need to include math, and sometimes code in my notes.
Typst is good at handling either of these.</p>
<h3 id="math">Math</h3>
<p>To write inline math, write <code>$1 + 1 = 2$</code> (no spaces),
and to write display math, write</p>
<pre><code>$
1 + 1 = 2.
$
</code></pre>
<p>(Configure your auto-pairs plugin to recognize <code>$</code> in Typst files.)
You can write multiline equations with <code>\</code>, and align them with <code>&#38;</code>, for instance</p>
<pre><code>$
2 &#38;= 1 + 1 \
  &#38;= 1 + 1 - 1 + 1
$
</code></pre>
<p>gives this output:</p>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/multiline.svg" alt="The output of the above Typst code." /></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the best part of Typst is how concise it is compared to LaTeX.
Instead of <code>\frac{3}{2}</code>, you can write <code>3&#47;2</code>,
and instead of <code>\mathbb{R}</code>, it&#8217;s just <code>RR</code>.
This conciseness is especially good for people like me who are typing lecture notes in real time in class.
At this point, I can sometimes type math faster than teachers can write it on the board.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/johanvx/typst-undergradmath/releases/download/v1.5.1/undergradmath.pdf">typst-undergradmath</a>
for a long list of examples of typesetting math in Typst.</p>
<p>Some things are still a bit tedious to write, though.
For instance, to type a sigma sum, you need to type <code>sum_(i=1)^n</code>.
While typing this expression, I mainly don&#8217;t like reaching my fingers off the home-row to reach the <code>^</code> key.
A similar issue occurs with definite integrals, which are written <code>integral_a^b</code>.
To optimize typing math, I use snippets in Neovim, specifically using the <a href="https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip">LuaSnip</a> plugin.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
Snippets are like textual templates that let you fill in the blanks.
When I type <code>sum</code> and then press Tab, it autocompletes the sum notation <code>sum_()^()</code>:</p>
<p><video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/public/img/typst-notes2/snippet.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video></p>
<p>Unlike in LaTeX though, snippets are more a convenience rather than a necessity
for typing fast, since Typst syntax is already short by itself. I would say
that even without snippets, as long as you type fast, you can write Typst
markup as fast as a lecturer writes on the board.</p>
<p>Snippets are also nice to use in other contexts,
like completing <code>today</code> to <code>2026-01-01</code> in a journal file.</p>
<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Other than math, you might also want to write code blocks in Typst.
Doing this is easy, and it uses the exact same notation as in Markdown, i.e. single ticks for inline code,
and three backticks for code blocks:</p>
<pre><code>This is `code`.

```python
print("this is code")
```</code></pre>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/code.svg" alt="The output of the above Typst code." /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s just like typing code on Discord,
and it even has syntax highlighting out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
<p>Another essential feature for writing lecture notes is drawing figures.
The system I use is still generally the same as Gilles Castel&#8217;s method:
draw figures in Inkscape, and include them in the Typst document.
However, compared to 2023, my setup is a bit different.
This is what the workflow looks like:</p>
<p><video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/public/img/typst-notes2/figure.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video></p>
<p>When writing notes, whenever I want to insert a figure, I use a <code>fig</code> snippet,
which inserts code like this:</p>
<pre><code>#figure(
  image("fig&#47;test2&#47;label.svg"),
  caption: [Caption],
) &#60;label&#62;
</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>label</code> and <code>Caption</code> bits are blanks in the snippet that I fill in, and
<code>test2</code> is the filename of the document.) Then, after naming the figure, I
hover over the filename and press a keybind to edit the snippet. The keybind triggers a <a href="https://github.com/dogeystamp/dots/blob/8299e0b2c0db4d287640e588d075985385fba81e/src/dot_local/bin/executable_typst-figure">script</a> (<code>typst-figure</code>)
which creates the file if it doesn&#8217;t exist, and then opens Inkscape.</p>
<p>One important difference from my old setup is that I now use the
<a href="https://textext.github.io/textext/">TexText</a> plugin to insert Typst math expressions
in my figures. I edited the source code in my version of TexText so that the &#8220;save text&#8221;
bind is <code>Ctrl-s</code>, which can be pressed by the left hand while my right hand
draws with the mouse.
Another difference is that I no longer use Gilles Castel&#8217;s Inkscape Shortcut Manager,
and instead just use the default Inkscape binds (which aren&#8217;t too bad actually).<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Something I did keep from Castel&#8217;s setup is the quick style changer. He had
&#8220;chorded&#8221; style keybinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Space + A: arrow</li>
<li>Space + A + G: bold<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> arrow</li>
<li>Space + S: stroke</li>
<li>Space + S + G: bold stroke</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on for a bunch of different styles. This lets you switch styles much
faster than Inkscape&#8217;s default binds. One issue I ran into using the style
switcher is that it needs a hacky X11 key event interceptor to make the binds
work. Since I switched to Wayland, that doesn&#8217;t work anymore. Now, I have
extracted Gilles&#8217; style code to a <a href="https://github.com/dogeystamp/dots/blob/8299e0b2c0db4d287640e588d075985385fba81e/src/dot_local/bin/executable_stylinator.py">Python
script</a>,
and I connect it to <code>fuzzel</code> (which is like <code>rofi</code> for Wayland) in a <a href="https://github.com/dogeystamp/dots/blob/8299e0b2c0db4d287640e588d075985385fba81e/src/dot_local/bin/executable_style.sh">style
switcher shell
script</a>.
Then, I use my window manager&#8217;s binds to trigger this style script. So the
process in Inkscape to switch styles becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Mod+A (calls style switcher).</li>
<li>Type the bind (e.g. <code>ag</code> for bold arrow) and press Enter<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>; this copies the style to clipboard.</li>
<li>Select an object in Inkscape and Ctrl+Shift+V to paste the style on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Admittedly, this method is slower, but it is more robust and will not break the moment I switch window managers.
It even has the potential to work on Windows, provided you have a replacement for <code>fuzzel</code> and the clipboard tools.</p>
<p>Castel claimed to be able to draw figures with his tools as fast as the
instructors could draw them on the board, but I still don&#8217;t have enough
experience after two years to do that yet. Perhaps I just don&#8217;t draw that many
figures in my lecture notes. Or maybe, my tooling is just not on his level.</p>
<h2 id="scripting">Scripting</h2>
<p>Typst is great not only because it&#8217;s nice to typeset with,
but also because it has a sane scripting language built in.
Typst is divided into a markup mode (i.e. normal, formatted text),
and code mode, where you can write scripts.
You enter code mode by typing <code>#</code>, and in code mode you can introduce markup with <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples.
If you need a small function that makes text bold and italic and smallcaps, Typst has got you:</p>
<pre><code>This is *markup* mode text

#let very-emph = (content) =&#62; strong(emph(smallcaps(content)))

#very-emph[
  This is highly emphasized _markup._
]
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/script.svg" alt="The output of the above Typst code." /></p>
<p>(<code>#very-emph[...]</code> is shorthand for <code>#very-emph([...])</code> which is calling the function <code>very-emph</code> on content.)
If you want to make something render conditionally, Typst can also do that:</p>
<pre><code>#if 1 + 1 == 2 [
    We have $1 + 1 = 2$.
] else [
    We have $1 + 1 != 2$??
]
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/script2.svg" alt="The output of the above Typst code." /></p>
<p>Generally, I&#8217;d say that if you are used to regular programming languages like
JavaScript, Typst&#8217;s scripting syntax will feel intuitive for you. See the later
chapters of the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/">Typst tutorial</a> for more
details.</p>
<p>I often use Typst&#8217;s scripting system for little things like
making my own shorthands in math mode.
For instance, when I want to write a L&#8217;Hôpital&#8217;s rule symbol, I use this code:</p>
<pre><code>#let hop = "(H)"

$
&#38;lim_(x-&#62;0) (sin x)&#47;x \
&#38;=_hop lim_(x-&#62;0) (cos x)&#47;1 \
&#38;=1
$
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/script3.svg" alt="The output of the above Typst code." /></p>
<p>These are simple examples, and Typst&#8217;s scripting language can do much more than that.
For instance, I made a <a href="https://github.com/dogeystamp/kindle_schedule">&#8220;smart&#8221; calendar</a>
powered by Typst&#8217;s scripting system.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>Writing in LaTeX or in Typst, users often have certain settings they want to
apply, like paper size, font, layout, and so on. Normally, we put these options
into a template file, and then reuse that template for every new document we
make.</p>
<p>In 2023, I rolled my own system for templates; I included all my
template code in a <code>.typ</code> file and imported it in each new document I made.
This was painful to use because there was no standard file path to import
templates from; I had to place documents next to the template, and import
by relative path, like <code>..&#47;..&#47;template.typ</code>.</p>
<p>Soon after I wrote that article, Typst made their own official packaging system
to easily distribute files like templates. Now, template authors publish
packages to the <a href="https://typst.app/universe">Typst Universe</a>
registry.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> This way, documents are self-contained: rather than
importing <code>..&#47;..&#47;template.typ</code>, which might only exist on your computer, you
import the standard package <code>@preview&#47;my-great-template:1.2.3</code>. You can send a
single <code>.typ</code> document to other people, or edit it on the Typst web app, and it
will work just fine.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I want to start a new document, I can create a new <code>.typ</code> file
anywhere, and import my template with this code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>#import "@preview&#47;mousse-notes:1.0.0": *
#set page(paper: "us-letter")
#show: book.with(
  title: [WUNK 101],
  subtitle: [Introduction to Wunkematics],
  subsubtitle: [Lecture notes, Fall 2023],
  subsubsubtitle: [Professor #smallcaps[Jonathan Bingus], University of Ipsum.],
  author: "John S. Student",
)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="/public/img/typst-notes2/template.png" alt="The output of the above Typst code." /></p>
<p>My template is available at its <a href="https://github.com/dogeystamp/mousse-notes">GitHub
repo</a>, but at the time of writing
it&#8217;s not uploaded to Typst Universe yet. Once it is up, you will also be able
to easily import it in your own documents.</p>
<p>Another thing I do differently than in 2023 is the organization of my notes.
In the past, I would make a new document for each chapter of a course;
now, each course&#8217;s notes are contained in a &#8220;book&#8221; compiled from a single Typst document.
This method reduces the amount of boilerplate you have to write,
and lets you start a new chapter by typing a new heading (which is just typing <code>= Heading name</code>).</p>
<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p>Typst Universe doesn&#8217;t just host templates; it also hosts plugins, which are also <code>.typ</code> scripts.
A lot of these are useful, for example <a href="https://typst.app/universe/package/whalogen/">whalogen</a>
provides shortcuts to type chemical equations,
and <a href="https://typst.app/universe/package/metro">metro</a> lets you type units.
It is even possible to <a href="https://typst.app/universe/package/pyrunner/">run Python in Typst</a>.</p>
<p>For many tasks though, plugins aren&#8217;t strictly necessary.
With <code>whalogen</code>, you can type <code>#ce("HCl + H2O -&#62; H3O+ + Cl-")</code>,
and without the plugin, it&#8217;s just longer: <code>$"HCl" + "H"_2"O" -&#62; "H"_3"O"^+ + "Cl"^-$</code>.</p>
<p>I personally dislike having extra dependencies, because it creates more
maintenance burden. Oftentimes, the Typst compiler will have a breaking change
(a downside of using software that is in its growth phase), and one
of the plugins I use will break, or have annoying deprecation warnings.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I don&#8217;t use external plugins anymore: my template includes my own
implementations of <code>#theorem</code>, <code>#definition</code>, <code>#example</code>, and so on. If it
breaks, it&#8217;s my fault solely, which is good because then I can fix the issue
myself.</p>
<h2 id="synchronizing-notes">Synchronizing notes</h2>
<p>You may want to synchronize your Typst files so you can write on multiple
devices. There are a few ways to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personally, I use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to manage my notes. The main
advantage of Git is that it is the industry standard for working with source
code, and it is a highly reliable tool. The disadvantage is that you need to
commit and push changes manually, which you might forget to do.
(I mainly write on a single device, so this is fine.)</li>
<li>You could use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>, which automatically syncs
files across your devices. It just works. One annoying thing is that when
there are sync conflicts, Syncthing will not notify you and it will instead
create a &#8220;sync-conflict&#8221; file.</li>
<li>The most practical option (but one that goes against the idea of using
local open-source tools) is to use the official closed-source <a href="https://typst.app">web
app</a> for Typst. Unlike the two other options, you need to
be online to access the web app. However, the web app synchronizes documents
perfectly and lets you collaborate in real time with other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first two options, make sure that you exclude <code>.pdf</code> outputs in <code>.gitignore</code> or <code>.stignore</code>
to save storage and bandwidth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s all for how my current note-taking setup works. A general theme
comparing the 2026 setup to the 2023 setup is that I&#8217;ve aimed for more
minimalism and simplicity: a system with less moving parts is more reliable,
and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Notably, all my documents are now fully self-contained: they import my template
from the standardized package registry rather than from a relative path, and
they do not have external links. If you&#8217;ve read the 2023 version of this post,
you&#8217;ll see that I created a convoluted setup to link between different PDF
files. I spent much effort building the link system, only to never use it. Now,
my documents are formatted as books that comprehensively cover one
subject, so that I only need to link within documents (which is a
feature Typst and PDF readers have good support for).<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Another way I&#8217;ve simplified the note-taking system is to trim out a lot of
brittle external code and dependencies. I&#8217;ve trimmed down Castel&#8217;s Inkscape tools to
the bare minimum, leaving only the style code itself, and as mentioned above,
I&#8217;ve stopped using external Typst plugins. The projects I do rely on are
generally well-maintained, like the Neovim editor, the Typst compiler itself,
and TexText.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future, I mainly wish I could reduce the complexity in
my Neovim configuration. That is, I want to stop using as many third party
plugins. The <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> editor (mentioned
above) is quite promising in that a lot of the functionality in Neovim plugins
(surround, Git gutter, telescope, lspconfig, tree-sitter, &#8230;) is available out
of the box in Helix and maintained by their team. Once they have solid snippet
support, I&#8217;ll switch fully to Helix and I&#8217;ll never again have to think about my
huge Neovim configuration file, and the headache of configuring a dozen
plugins.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far. If you have any questions or comments regarding
this post, please do write to me, and I&#8217;ll be happy to reply to you.</p>

<p>Some of the binds I use are &#8220;toggle snap to grid&#8221; (%),

<p>Removing inter-document links and enforcing a rule of &#8220;one subject,
one document&#8221; is perhaps not ideal for those who want a personal knowledge

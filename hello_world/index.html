<h1 id="hello-world-from-barf.sh">hello world (from barf.sh)</h1>
<p>2023-05-14</p>
<p>Another year, another static site generator.</p>
<p>This time, for the <a href="https://git.dogeystamp.com/dogeystamp/wb5">5th iteration</a> of the website,
I&#8217;m using <a href="https://barf.bt.ht">barf</a> to generate it.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the old script I was using, <a href="https://romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg</a>,
was really hacky in comparison to barf.
One of my biggest grudges is how there was no post list on the front page by default.
Most of the people using ssg (including me) had to write their own messy <code>sed</code> contraptions to implement it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, barf implements not only the post list, but also Atom feed generation, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Other than that, barf excels by being tiny.
Unlike ssg, the barf script fits in 3 screenfuls of text for me.
In my opinion, it&#8217;s much more readable.</p>
<p>The great thing about these two scripts is that migrating my website from one to the other is really simple.
They both work similarly, so I just needed minor changes to port over my (admittedly few) pages.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;ll hopefully write some blog posts soon and fix the remaining dead links on the website.</p>
